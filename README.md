I tried to do my own take on Arkanoid SFML when i realised that I dont really know how to do the collisions right.
Then i've found this : (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4K3tsKa1Uc) video.
After watching it the very next day I tried to recreate everything from memory and from what I've understood from the day before.
This is my take on that, I must admit that brick collisions are actually rewritten from the video, I will take my time to fully understand what is going on with them.
